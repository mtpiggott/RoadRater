Metrics:
    Twists per Mile:

        much activity there is for the driver. The higher the number the 
        better.

        The median angle of curves that make up a road. Indicator of how many
        g-forces one feels over the course of the road. The higher the number
        the better.

    Remoteness:
        Distance of the middle of the road from a town. Indicator of road
        crowding. The higher the number the better.
